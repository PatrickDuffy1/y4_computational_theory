    "SHA-256 operates on 512-bit blocks, so messages must be padded to a length that is a multiple of 512 bits. The padding process follows a specific sequence defined by the SHA-2 specification:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Padding Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a message of any length:\n",
    "1. **Append a single `1` bit** (expressed as the byte `0x80`).\n",
    "2. **Append `0` bits** (i.e., `0x00` bytes) until the length of the message (in bits) is congruent to `448 mod 512`. This leaves 64 bits at the end.\n",
    "3. **Append the original message length in bits** as a 64-bit big-endian unsigned integer.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- The `0x80` represents the `1` bit required at the start of the padding.\n",
    "- `0x00` bytes are added until the total length (including padding and length field) reaches a multiple of 512 bits.\n",

    "\n",
    "The goal of this task is to implement and compare two algorithms for generating prime numbers. The goal is to generate the first 100 prime numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trial Division** – a straightforward method based on checking divisibility.\n",
    "2. **Wilson’s Theorem** – an approach based on factorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prime Numbers\n",
    "A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Trial Division\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_division  \n",
    "- **Method**: Check each number by attempting to divide it by all smaller integers (excluding itself).\n",
    "- **Complexity**: Time-consuming for large numbers, especially without optimization (like checking up to √n).\n",

    "https://www.britannica.com/science/Wilsons-theorem  \n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson%27s_theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Theorem**: A number \\( p > 1 \\) is prime if and only if: $$ (p - 1)! \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p} $$\n",
    "- **Method**: Use factorials and modulo arithmetic to check if numbers are primes.\n",
    "- **Complexity**: Very slow and memory-intensive for large \\( p \\) due to factorial growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement both methods as Python functions.\n",

    "- **Leading Zeros**: The number of consecutive zeros at the beginning of a binary hash — used as a proxy for \"mining difficulty\" in our simulation.\n",
